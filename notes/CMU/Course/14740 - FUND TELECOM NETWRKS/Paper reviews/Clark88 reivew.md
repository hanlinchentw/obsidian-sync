### Title: THE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY OF THE DARPA INTERNET PROTOCOLS

### Summary
This paper examines the successes and tradeoffs of the Internet's original design priorities. The datagram model ensured the Internet's core goals of survivability and flexibility, enabling widespread adoption in both military and commercial settings. However, the stateless nature of datagrams makes it difficult to manage resources and ensure accountability. To address these problems, the author proposes the concept of a _flow_—a way to group datagrams into sequences—allowing gateways to maintain "soft state." This idea provides both resilience and improved service management.

### Valid Points / Justifications

1. **Datagram / Packet-Switched Successes**
    - **Survivability**
        - Stateless nature prevents network-wide failure caused by single points of failure.
	- **Flexibility**
        - By keeping IP **stateless and simple**, higher layers are free to define their own behaviors.
        - This allows very different kinds of transport protocols to coexist:
	        - TCP: reliable, connection orientated
	        - UDP: lightweight, connectionless
	        - QUIC[2].: modern, encrypted, low-latency transport
2. **Limitations in Resource Management and Accountability**
    - Datagram is stateless, making it difficult to trace usage or manage resources effectively.
3. **Flow Concept**
	- **Soft State**
        - Flows preserve a lightweight form of state, enabling gateways to track and manage data sequences without breaking resilience.

### My Thought on the paper
1. Given that the Internet architecture avoids constraining performance and redundancy, how can network designers obtain concrete guidance to implement survivable systems? Should architectural standards go beyond logical correctness to also include performance and redundancy guidelines?
2. I propose implementing the flow method on top of datagrams by introducing explicit boundaries. This can be achieved by adding a _start_ and _end_ marker, along with a Flow ID, in the datagram header. Doing so would allow gateways to recognize packet sequences as flows, enabling better resource management and accountability. However, this approach introduces tradeoffs. Adding flow-related fields increases the header size, which may consume additional bandwidth. Moreover, gateways would need to maintain and process flow state, which could introduce performance overhead and scalability challenges, especially in high-speed networks.
