### Summary
This paper reviews Internet design tradeoffs: datagrams enable survivability and flexibility but hinder resources management and accountability. The proposed flow model balances resilience and service management.
### The most important points
1. **Datagram / Packet-Switched Successes**
    - **Survivability**
        - Stateless nature prevents network-wide failure caused by single points of failure.
	- **Flexibility**
        - By keeping IP **stateless and simple**, higher layers are free to define their own behaviors.
        - This allows very different kinds of transport protocols to coexist:
	        - TCP: reliable, connection orientated
	        - UDP: lightweight, connectionless
	        - QUIC[^2]: modern, encrypted, low-latency transport
2. **Limitations in Resource Management and Accountability**
    - Datagram is stateless in the networks, making it difficult to trace usage or manage resources effectively.
3. **Flow Concept**
	- Flows preserve a lightweight form of state, called soft state, allowing gateways to track and manage data sequences without sacrificing resilience.
### Questions/Comments
1. Given that the Internet architecture avoids constraining performance and redundancy, how can network designers obtain concrete guidance to implement survivable systems? Should these architectural standards go beyond logical correctness to also include implementation manuals or guidelines that ensure performance and redundancy?
2. I propose implementing the flow method on top of datagrams by introducing explicit boundaries. This can be achieved by adding a _start_ and _end_ marker, along with a Flow ID, in the datagram header. Doing so would allow gateways to recognize packet sequences as flows, enabling better resource management and accountability. However, this approach introduces tradeoffs. Adding flow-related fields increases the header size, which may consume additional bandwidth. Moreover, gateways would need to maintain and process flow state, which could introduce performance overhead and scalability challenges, especially in high-speed networks.
