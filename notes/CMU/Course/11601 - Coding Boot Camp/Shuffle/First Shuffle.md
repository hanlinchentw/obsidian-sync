Question: 27.8, 27.2, 26.2

### 27.8 3-way merge without duplicates
Given three sorted arrays, arr1, arr2, and arr3, return a new array with the elements of all three arrays, in sorted order, without duplicates.

> Example: arr1 = [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7], arr2 = [3, 3, 9], arr3 = [3, 3, 9]
> Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]


Hint 1: Break down the problem
How can merging three arrays be simplified by using a helper function that merges two arrays at a time?
Can you reuse a function for merging two sorted arrays and apply it twice to handle three arrays?

Hint 2: Merge two arrays approach
When merging two sorted arrays, how do you track the current position in each array (e.g., pointers or indices)?
How do you decide which element to add next to the result to maintain sorting?

Hint 3: Remove duplicates while merging
How can you ensure no duplicate values are added to the result during merging?
Would using a set to track already added elements be helpful?
How can you combine this with the merging process efficiently?

Solution:
```python
def mergeThree(arr1, arr2, arr3):
    return mergeTwo(mergeTwo(arr1, arr2), arr3)

def mergeTwo(arr1, arr2):
    seen = set()
    p1 = p2 = 0
    result = []

    while p1 < len(arr1) and p2 < len(arr2):
        if arr1[p1] < arr2[p2]:
            if arr1[p1] not in seen:
                result.append(arr1[p1])
                seen.add(arr1[p1])
            p1 += 1
        else:
            if arr2[p2] not in seen:
                result.append(arr2[p2])
                seen.add(arr2[p2])
            p2 += 1

    while p1 < len(arr1):
        if arr1[p1] not in seen:
            result.append(arr1[p1])
            seen.add(arr1[p1])
        p1 += 1

    while p2 < len(arr2):
        if arr2[p2] not in seen:
            result.append(arr2[p2])
            seen.add(arr2[p2])
        p2 += 1

    return result
```
### 27.2 Smaller prefixes
Given an array of integers, arr, where the length, n, is even, return whether the following condition holds for every k in the range 
`1 <= k <= n/2`: "the sum of the first k elements is smaller than the sum of the first 2k elements." if this condition is false for any k in the range, return false.

> Example: arr = [1, 2, 2, -1]
> Output: True. The prefix [1] has a smaller sum than the prefix [1, 2], and the prefix [1, 2] has a smaller sum than the prefix [1, 2, 2, -1]. The other prefixes have length > n/2

> Example: arr = [1, 2, -2, 1, 3, 5]
> Output: False. The prefix [1, 2] has a larger sum than the prefix [1, 2, -2, 1].

Constraint:
arr length >= 2

Possible Solution: Two pointers, prefix sum

Hint 1:
Can you track two different sums at the same time, each representing the sum of different prefix lengths (k and 2k)?

Hint 2: 
Consider two pointers or indices moving with different steps
Think of maintaining two running sums simultaneouslyâ€”one for the prefix length k, one for prefix length 2k.

Two pointers:
```python
def smaller_prefixes(arr):
  if not arr:
    return False
  slow, fast = 0, 0
  slow_sum, fast_sum = 0, 0
  while fast < len(arr):
    slow_sum += arr[slow]
    fast_sum += arr[fast] + arr[fast+1]
    if slow_sum >= fast_sum:
      return False
    slow_sum += 1
    fast_sum += 2
  return True
```

Prefix:
```python
def smaller_prefixes(arr):
    if not arr:
        return False
    n = len(arr)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n+1)
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + arr[i]

    for k in range(1, n // 2):
        if prefix_sum[k] >= prefix_sum[2*k]:
            return False
    return True
```

### 26.2
Without using a built-in string join method, implement a join(arr, s) method, which receives an array of strings, arr, and a string s, and returns a single consisting of the strings in arr with s in between them.
> Example 1
> arr = ["join", "by", "space"], s = " "
> Output: "join by space"

Example 2
> arr = ["b", "", "k", "p", "r n", "", "d", "d!!"], s = "ee"
> Output: "beeeekeepeer neeeedeed!!"

Since python string is immutable, assume that you have access to a function array_to_string(arr), which takes an array of individual characters and returns a string with those characters in O(len(arr)) time.

Solution:
```python
def join(arr, s):
  res = []
  for i in range(len(arr)):
    if i != 0:
	  for c in s:
        res.append(c)
    for c in arr[i]:
      res.append(c)
  return array_to_string(res)
```
