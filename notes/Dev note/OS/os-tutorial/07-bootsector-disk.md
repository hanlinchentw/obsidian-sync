Knowledge
### **Heads** refer to:

> The number of **read/write heads** in a **cylinder-head-sector (CHS)** disk geometry.

- Each **platter surface** in a hard drive has a **head**.
    
- For example, a 2-sided floppy has 2 heads ‚Äî one for each side.

**Goal: Let the bootsector load data from disk in order to boot the kernel**

we need to read data from a disk in order to run the kernel.

we set¬†`al`¬†to¬†`0x02`¬†(and other registers with the required cylinder, head and sector) and raise¬†`int 0x13`
[a detailed int 13h guide here](http://stanislavs.org/helppc/int_13-2.html)

### BIOS Read Service (`int 13h, AH = 02h`)

|Register|Purpose (on entry)|Example here|
|---|---|---|
|`AH`|Function code **02h** ‚Üí _Read Sectors_|`0x02`|
|`AL`|Number of sectors to read (1 ‚Äì 128)|copied from `DH` = `2`|
|`CH`|Cylinder (low 8 bits)|`0x00`|
|`CL`|Sector # (bits 0-5) + cylinder (high 2 bits)|`0x02`|
|`DH`|**Head #**|`0x00`|
|`DL`|Drive # set by BIOS (e.g., `0x00` floppy, `0x80` HDD)|_(inherited)_|
|`ES:BX`|Memory buffer address **for incoming data**|`0000:9000`|

#### Code Walk-Through
```
; --- set up request ---
mov dh, 2        ; sectors to read  ‚Üí also copied to AL
mov al, dh

mov cl, 0x02     ; starting sector   (sector-1 is the boot sector)
mov ch, 0x00     ; cylinder 0
mov bx, 0x9000   ; offset for ES:BX  (ES assumed 0)

mov ah, 0x02     ; BIOS read
int 0x13         ; read 2 sectors ‚Üí 0x9000
jc  disk_error   ; CF=1  ‚Üí BIOS error
```

#### Post-call verification

```
pop dx           ; restore original DX (so DH = requested sector count)
cmp al, dh       ; AL = sectors actually read
jne sectors_error
```

_Effectively:_ **‚ÄúDid BIOS read as many sectors as we asked?‚Äù**

### Result

After the `disk_load` call:

|Address|Contains|
|---|---|
|`0x9000`|Sector 2 (filled with `0xDADA`)|
|`0x9000+512`|Sector 3 (filled with `0xFACE`)|



In the int 13h interrupt, we set ah to 0x02 for read sector mode.
and set the al (number of sectors) we want to read to dh (in this case is 2).
and we set the cl (sector number) to 2.
```
mov ah, 0x02
mov al, dh
mov cl, 0x02
```


### **Prepare to Load Sectors**

```
mov bx, 0x9000
mov dh, 2
```

- **`ES:BX = 0x9000`** ‚Üí The address where the read sectors will be loaded by definition.
- **`DH = 2`** ‚Üí Read **2 sectors** starting from sector 2 (i.e., sector 2 and 3).

- The BIOS sets `DL` with the boot disk number (e.g., `0x00` for floppy, `0x80` for HDD).
- `BX` will be used in `disk_load` as `ES:BX = 0000:9000`, i.e., physical address `0x9000`.

```
call disk_load
```
- Invokes the disk_load function (defined in boot_sect_disk.asm).
- This uses int 0x13 to read sectors into 0x9000.
- After this call:
	- 0x9000 contains sector 2 (filled with 0xDADA values),
	- 0x9000 + 512 contains sector 3 (filled with 0xFACE values).

## Why Must We Prepare the Stack?

### 1. üí• **BIOS doesn‚Äôt set it up**

When the BIOS loads your boot sector at `0x7C00`, it does **not** initialize the stack for you.  
So:

- `SS` and `SP` are unpredictable.
    
- If you use `call`, `ret`, `push`, or `pop` **without setting the stack**, you'll **corrupt random memory** or **crash**.
