**Goal: Learn to write the same low-level code as we did with assembler, but in C**
## Compile

To compile system-independent code, we need the flagÂ `-ffreestanding`
```
i386-elf-gcc -ffreestanding -c myFile.c -o myFile.o
```

Let's examine the machine code generated by the compiler:

`i386-elf-objdump -d myFile.o`
