#### Introduction

Ever tried updating `@State` from a ViewModel in SwiftUI, only to hit a wall? Youâ€™re not alone. MVVM promises separation of concerns and improved testabilityâ€”but its imperative nature often clashes with SwiftUIâ€™s declarative design. The result? Awkward workarounds, fragile code, and mounting frustration.

As one popular [Apple Developer Forums thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/699003) puts it: forcing MVVM onto SwiftUI is like "**taking the magic power from SwiftUI.**" Instead of embracing the frameworkâ€™s strengths, you're constantly fighting against them.

Take this common scenario:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
	@Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
    @State var isLoading = false
    @StateObject var viewModel = ViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        if isLoading {
            ProgressView()
        } else {
            Text("Loaded!")
        }
    }
}

final class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    func onAppear() { 
	    // Canâ€™t directly change `isLoading` in the view.
    }
	func onPressCancel() { 
		// Canâ€™t directly call `dismiss` in the view.
	}
}
```

Here, the ViewModel has no access to the viewâ€™s local `@State` or environment values like `dismiss`. This disconnect often leads to awkward binding gymnastics or bloated view logicâ€”both of which violate MVVMâ€™s original intent.

So how can we preserve MVVMâ€™s benefitsâ€”modularity, testability, maintainabilityâ€”without the friction?

Enter the **Presentationalâ€“Container pattern**: a SwiftUI-native refinement that bridges the gap between business logic and declarative UI. By cleanly separating stateful containers from stateless views, it lets you enjoy the best of both worlds.
#### Understanding the Presentational-Container Pattern

Originally popularized in the React community, the Presentationalâ€“Container pattern separates rendering from logic by splitting UI into two parts: **containers** that manage state and behavior, and **presentational components** that focus solely on layout and interaction. The result is simpler, more testable, and reusable code.

Applied to SwiftUI, this pattern embraces its declarative nature while preserving MVVMâ€™s core strength: **separation of concerns**.

- **Container**: Manages state, connects to the ViewModel, prepares props, and handles SwiftUI-specific behaviors like alerts or navigation.
    
- **Presentational Component**: A stateless, reusable view responsible only for presentation.

This structure avoids fragile workarounds and leads to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
### Building Presentational Components

Presentational components are pure, stateless, and easy to reason about.  
The key principle is simple: **Presentational Components never own state**. Instead, they declare what they need and let the container provide it.
```swift
struct FeedView: View {
    let isLoading: Bool
    let feeds: [Feed]
    let onAppear: () -> Void
    let onPressFeed: (Feed) -> Void
    let onRefresh: () -> Void

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            if isLoading {
                ProgressView("Loading...")
            } else {
	            List {
		            ForEach(feeds) { feed in
	                    FeedRowView(feed: feed, onTap: { onPressFeed(feed) })
	                }
	            }
                .refreshable(action: onRefresh)
            }
        }
        .onAppear(perform: onAppear)
    }
}
```
Presentational views are:
âœ… Stateless  
âœ… Easily previewable  
âœ… Reusable across use cases  
âœ… Simple to test

Because they donâ€™t depend on how data is fetched or stored, these components are highly reusable and testableâ€”whether your data comes from an API, a local cache, or mock objects.

### Implementing Container Components

Container components handle everything presentational views shouldnâ€™t:

- `@State` / `@StateObject` for transient UI state
- ViewModel interaction and coordination
- Dependencies like `@Environment` and injected services
- Side effects (networking, navigation, etc.)
- Lifecycle and user interaction callbacks
#### From MVVM to Containers

The Presentational-Container pattern doesnâ€™t replace MVVMâ€”it **builds on it**.

**Traditional MVVM Structure**:

```
View â†” ViewModel â†” Model
```

**Enhanced with Container**:

```
Container â†” ViewModel â†” Model
    â†“
Presentational Component
```

The ViewModel still handles business rules and data, but the **Container** acts as the SwiftUI-native layer that:

- Maps ViewModel state to presentational props
    
- Owns ephemeral state (`@State`)
    
- Manages side effects and lifecycle events

**Here's how it works in practice**:

swift

```swift
class FeedViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isFetchingData = false
    @Published var feeds: [Feed] = []
    @Published var error: Error?
    
    func loadFeeds() async { /* business logic */ }
    func refreshFeeds() async { /* business logic */ }
}
```

```swift
struct FeedContainerView: View {
    @Environment(\.router) var router: Router
    @StateObject private var viewModel = FeedViewModel()
    @State private var selectedFeed: Feed?

    var body: some View {
        FeedView(
            isLoading: viewModel.isFetchingData,
            feeds: viewModel.feeds,
            errorMessage: viewModel.errorMessage,
            onAppear: { Task { await viewModel.loadFeeds() } },
            onPressFeed: handleFeedSelection,
            onRefresh: { Task { await viewModel.refreshFeeds() } },
            onRetry: { Task { await viewModel.loadFeeds() } }
        )
    }

    private func handleFeedSelection(_ feed: Feed) {
        selectedFeed = feed
        router.push(.feedDetail(feed))
    }
}
```

Here, the **container** connects the ViewModelâ€™s output to the UI, handles transient selection state, and drives navigation. The **presentational view** stays pure and reusable.

### A Real-World Architecture

A full SwiftUI app using this pattern might be structured like this:
```mermaid
graph TD
    Router[Router<br/>] -.-> FeedContainerView[FeedContainer<br/>]
    Router -.-> FeedDetailContainer[FeedDetailContainer<br/>]

    FeedContainerView --> FeedView[FeedView<br/>ðŸ“± List UI]
    FeedContainerView --> FeedViewModel[FeedViewModel<br/>ðŸ§  Business Logic]

    FeedDetailContainer --> FeedDetailView[FeedDetailView<br/>]

    FeedViewModel --> FeedService[FeedService<br/>ðŸ”§ Data Layer]

    FeedContainerView -.->|props| FeedView
    FeedDetailContainer -.->|props| FeedDetailView

    classDef container fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0277bd,stroke-width:3px
    classDef presenter fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:2px
    classDef viewmodel fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:2px
    classDef service fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:2px

    class FeedContainerView,FeedDetailContainer container
    class FeedView,FeedDetailView presenter
    class FeedViewModel viewmodel
    class FeedService service
```
This architecture embraces SwiftUIâ€™s strengthsâ€”**clear data flow, testability, and composability**â€”without abandoning structure or scalability.

### Summary

**What Containers Do**
- Transform business state into UI-ready props
- Handle SwiftUI-specific concerns (alerts, sheets, navigation)
- Coordinate side effects and user interactions
- Bridge imperative logic with declarative UI

**Why It Works**
- **Reduces cognitive load** â€“ views stay focused purely on layout and interaction
- **Enhances reusability** â€“ presentational views work with any data source (API, DB, mock)
- **Simplifies testing** â€“ pure components are trivial to test and preview
- **Improves maintainability** â€“ separation of concerns makes code easier to reason about

Think of containers as **smart adapters**: they manage orchestration so your views can stay simple, pure, and focused.

No matter your architectureâ€”MVVM, TCA, or something customâ€”this pattern helps you write **cleaner, more scalable SwiftUI code** by working _with_ the framework, instead of fighting against it.
