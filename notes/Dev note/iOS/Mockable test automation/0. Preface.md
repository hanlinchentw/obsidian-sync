#### Seamlessly Mock and Intercept API Responses for Full App Control

It's always hard to manage different dependencies while doing software tests, especially for the source that you cannot control, like API.
This tool aim to solve this obstacle. The main purpose of this setup is to intercept the network request before it reaches to the real world network. Once it intercepts the request, it can mock the response by sending our pre-determined results.
This method is very useful because it can mock various scenarios. When doing TUIT (Targeted UI test) which is used to test specific pages, this tool can gain full control to test user flows, verify edge cases, and debug network behavior.
