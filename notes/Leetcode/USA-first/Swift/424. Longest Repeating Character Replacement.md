### Thinkingï¼š
1. find all unique character, loop through them and take them as our target
2. if next is not our target, and still have k, expand, otherwise, shrink
3. if is our target, just expand
4. record the max length result
5. 

### Solution:
```
class Solution {
    func characterReplacement(_ s: String, _ k: Int) -> Int {
        
    }
}
```
