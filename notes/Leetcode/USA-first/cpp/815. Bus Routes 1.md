### Thinkingï¼š

1. build a stop map, take `[[1,2,7], [3,6,7]]` as example
	1. "1": [2, 7]
	2. "2": [1, 7]
	3. "7": [1, 6]
	4. "6": [3, 7]
	5. "3": [6, 7]
2. need another map to record which bus the stops are located.
	1. 

### Solution:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numBusesToDestination(vector<vector<int>>& routes, int source, int target) {
        
    }
};
```
